Welcome to the `Software Sustainability Institute's <https://www.software.ac.uk/about>`_  Event Organisation Guide. The Institute has built up a large amount of experience `organising events <https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/other-workshops>`_,  ranging from a few to around 100 attendees. This guide goes through the steps of organising an event and is structured around the way the Institute organises its workshops and events. 

We use the `Collaborations Workshop (CW) <https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/collaborations-workshops>`_ series, one of our larger and more complex events, as one of our main examples throughout this guide. The CW series combine audience-led sessions in the style of an `‘unconference’ <https://web.archive.org/web/20211016235851/https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-28-running-unconference-top-tips>`_ and traditional workshop sessions. CW has around 80-100 attendees and there is no call for papers but a call for mini-workshops.
